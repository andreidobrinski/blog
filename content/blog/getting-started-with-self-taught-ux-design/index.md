description: Some resources that helped me when I was starting
---

There are plenty of good resources out there to start to teach yourself UX Design. These are some of the resources I enjoyed on my self-taught path.

This is meant to be more of a living document than an exhaustive list.

This list is meant to complement the approach of learning while doing. I find that what works best for me is cycling through theoretical study, tutorials, and applying that knowledge to designing my own apps. To each their own!
